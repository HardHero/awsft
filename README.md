# awsft
*Purpose
While working in Chef, I needed a way to get a new simple server for node bootstrapping. AWS Free Tier offers a completely free machine, but setting up a new instance of one takes time. These are just a set of scripts to speed this process up.

*Sys req
  ubuntu 14.04
  Note: these are untested on other systems

*Getting Set Up
1.Install AWS CLI: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html#install-with-pip
2.Install jq: apt-get install jq
